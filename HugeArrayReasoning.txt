Describe and explain what happens when you try to compile a program HugeArray.java with the following statement:
int n = 1000;
int[] a = new int[n*n*n*n];

ANSWER:
The multiplication exceeds the memory limit to store the result. if we reduce n^4 to n^2, it works fine!
when n is 200, the memory isn't sufficient enough to allocate those values.
